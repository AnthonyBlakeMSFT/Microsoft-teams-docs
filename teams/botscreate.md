# Creating and Testing a bot for Microsoft Teams (preview)

All bots created using the Microsoft Bot Framework are automatically configured and ready to work in Microsoft Teams.

> **Note:** During Preview, only sideloading of bots is allowed, and only if enabled in the Office Admin portal. [More Information](setup.md). 

See the [Microsoft Bot Framework Overview](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/) to learn how to:

1. Register the bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework, and make sure you add Microsoft Teams as a channel. When you first register a bot it will be in preview, which means that it is only available to users in Microsoft Teams via side loading of the bot ID or via add button.
2. Build a bot using the [C# SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/), [Node.js SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html) or [Microsoft Bot Connector API](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/connector/#navtitle).

3. Test it using the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/)
4. Deploy the bot to a cloud service, such as [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
5. [Add the bot](#testing-your-bot-in-microsoft-teams) to a Microsoft Teams 1:1 chat, and test.
