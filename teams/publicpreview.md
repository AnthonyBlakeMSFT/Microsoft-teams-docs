# What is the Public Developer Preview?

Public Developer Preview is a program for developers that provides early access to unreleased features. Features included in preview may not be complete and may undergo changes before becoming available in the Public release. 

## How to get access?
To participate in the Public Developer Preview, you need to do the following: 

1.	Turn on the setting for enabling side-loading of bots in the admin console of your tenant as described [here](setup.md#enable-sideloading-of-apps-for-microsoft-teams).

2.	Once that is done, the Teams client will show a menu item for switching to the developer preview under Menu -> About as shown below.

Note that features available to you in preview mode may result in messages that don't render correctly for other people who may be on a Public version of the Teams client.

## How do I turn it off?
Use the same menu item under Menu -> About -> Developer preview, and click on it to turn it off.

## What features will I have access to? 
The list of features available in preview mode are described [here](previewfeatures.md).
