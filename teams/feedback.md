The Microsoft Team (preview) product team responds to the developer community across several channels. Please tell us about your:

- **General questions:** Please send mail to [Microsoft Teams developer support](mailto:microsoftteamsdev@microsoft.com).

- **Programming questions:** We listen and respond on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-teams). Follow the [guidance](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) about what makes a good question on Stackoverflow.  Tag your question with "microsoft-teams" so that our team and the Microsoft Teams developer community can spot your question.

- **Documentation bugs:** If you find a bug in the Microsoft Teams SDK documentation, open an [issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-docs/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to tell us which topic is factually incorrect or unclear. To help us fix the problem more quickly, quote the text to be changed. 

- **Sample application bugs:** If you find a bug in one of our samples, open an issue on GitHub. Be sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug.

- **Feature requests:** If our platform doesn't empower you to what you need, please make your features suggestions on the [Microsoft Teams feedback portal on UserVoice](https://aka.ms/microsoftteamsplatformsuggestions).

- **Contributions:** We accept pull requests against the Microsoft Teams JS library, documentation and samples. If you'd like to contribute, please see the contributor's guide in each repo.
