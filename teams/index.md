> **Don't have Microsoft Teams? Get a free one-year trial.** To get started developing for Microsoft Teams, you'll need an Office 365 account, and to turn on Teams for your organization. [Here's how](setup.md).

## Tabs

Tab apps allow teams to collect together all the tools they need inside of Microsoft Teams.  Team members can add your tab to a channel, and can have conversations about it. It's easy to create a tab from your existing web app.

Common tab app examples are:

* Dashboards and data visualization
* Collaborative documents and note taking
* Group task management
* Shared design canvas

Currently, tab apps are supported in Microsoft Teams desktop and web applications.

## Bots

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with Microsoft Teams users naturally through 1:1 chat. Bots that can answer natural language and perform lightweight tasks such as querying bug information or kicking off a build.​ Any bot created using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) are automatically configured and ready to work in Microsoft Teams.

## Connectors

Office 365 Connectors are a great way to get useful information and content into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect their group to services like Trello, Bing News, Twitter, etc., and get notified of the team's activity in that service. From tracking a team's progress in Trello, to following important hashtags in Twitter, Office 365 Connectors make it easier for your team to stay in sync and get more done.

Office 365 Connectors also provide a compelling extensibility solution for developers. Developers can build connectors through incoming webhooks to generate rich connector cards.
