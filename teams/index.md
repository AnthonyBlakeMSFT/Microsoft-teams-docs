# Microsoft Teams development

extend and make your team even more collaborative and effective

## Custom tabs

The Microsoft Teams SDK lets you quickly and easily connect your web based team tools and content to a team channel through custom Tabs. 
Custom Tabs let a team access tools and content in context with a single mouse click. Instead of sending team members to a web browser where they
rely on bookmarked web apps, bring those web apps into the Skype Teams experience using Tabs. It's very easy to create a tab from an existing web app.  
The Microsoft Teams Tab Platform provides the tools to author, package, and distribute these tab apps.

Currently, custom tabs are only supported in Microsoft Teams desktop and web applications.

## Connectors

Office 365 Connectors are a great way to get useful information and content into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect their group to services like Trello, Bing News, Twitter, etc., and get notified of the team's activity in that service. From tracking a team's progress in Trello, to following important hashtags in Twitter, Office 365 Connectors make it easier for your team to stay in sync and get more done.

Office 365 Connectors also provide a compelling extensibility solution for developers. Developers can build connectors through incoming webhooks to generate rich connector cards.
