# Microsoft Teams development


## Custom tabs

The Skype Teams SDK lets you quickly and easily connect your web based team tools and content to a team channel through custom Tabs. 
Custom Tabs let a team access tools and content in context with a single mouse click. Instead of sending team members to a web browser where they
rely on bookmarked web apps, bring those web apps into the Skype Teams experience using Tabs. It's very easy to create a tab from an existing web app.  
The Skype Teams Tab Platform provides the tools to author, package, and distribute these tab apps.

Currently, custom tabs are only supported in Microsoft Teams desktop and web applications.

## Bots

Bots that can answer natural language and perform lightweight tasks such as querying bug information or kicking off a build.​ 

Currently, bots are only supported in 1:1 chats.
