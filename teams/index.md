# Microsoft Teams development


## Custom tabs

The Skype Teams SDK lets you quickly and easily connect your web based team tools and content to a team channel through custom Tabs. 
Custom Tabs let a team access tools and content in context with a single mouse click. Instead of sending team members to a web browser where they
rely on bookmarked web apps, bring those web apps into the Skype Teams experience using Tabs. It's very easy to create a tab from an existing web app.  
The Skype Teams Tab Platform provides the tools to author, package, and distribute these tab apps.
