# Microsoft Teams development

Use the Microsoft Teams SDK to extend Microsoft Teams and make your team even more collaborative and effective.

## Custom tabs

Quickly and easily connect your web-based team tools and content to a team channel through custom tabs. Custom Tabs let a team access tools and content in context with a single mouse click. Instead of sending team members to a web browser where they rely on bookmarked web apps, bring those web apps into the Microsoft Teams experience using Tabs. It's easy to create a tab from an existing web app.  

Currently, custom tabs are supported in Microsoft Teams desktop and web applications.

## Bots

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with Microsoft Teams users naturally through 1:1 chat. Bots that can answer natural language and perform lightweight tasks such as querying bug information or kicking off a build.​ Any bot created using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) are automatically configured and ready to work in Microsoft Teams.

Currently, bots are supported in 1:1 chats.

## Connectors

Office 365 Connectors are a great way to get useful information and content into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect their group to services like Trello, Bing News, Twitter, etc., and get notified of the team's activity in that service. From tracking a team's progress in Trello, to following important hashtags in Twitter, Office 365 Connectors make it easier for your team to stay in sync and get more done.

Office 365 Connectors also provide a compelling extensibility solution for developers. Developers can build connectors through incoming webhooks to generate rich connector cards.
