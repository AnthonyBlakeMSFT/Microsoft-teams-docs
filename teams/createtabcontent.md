# Create the content for your Microsoft Teams tab

Once you have determined the URL of the content the user wants, based on user configuration choices, you send that URL to Microsoft Teams  to display that content in the new tab.

## Prerequisites for content displayed in your tab

For your content to display within a Microsoft Teams tab, make sure it meets the [requirements for tab app UI](gettingstarted.md#prerequisites-for-your-tabs-app-ui).

In addition, make sure your content conforms to the [design recommendations](design.md) for Microsoft Teams tabs.
