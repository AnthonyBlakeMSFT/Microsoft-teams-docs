# Getting Started with Bots for Microsoft Teams (preview)

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with Microsoft Teams users naturally through chat.  Or bring your existing bot from another channel, and add Teams-specific support to make your experience shine.

## Bots in Microsoft Teams

At this time, Microsoft Teams bots support 1:1 and channel chats. They do not yet support group chats. 

Bots appear in Teams with a hexagonal avatar.  They always appear online and do not have a mood message.

## Overview of building a Microsoft Teams bot

Microsoft Teams supports much of the common BotFramework functionality.  Follow these steps to build a great Teams bot:

- Design a great bot: Microsoft Teams is the place for group and team collaboration.  Consider what functionality your bot can bring to this collaboration environment, via both 1:1 conversations, or when added as part of a channel conversation.  A great bot on Teams will also find ways to leverage the unique Tabs feature.
- [Create and register your bot in the BotFramework](botscreate.md):  Take advantage of the great tools, documentation, and community provided by the BotFramework team.
- [Develop your bot](botsconversation.md): Add basic conversation flow and leverage channel-specific functionality. 
- [Add your bot to Microsoft teams](botsadd.md):  Whether invoking in a 1:1 conversation, or adding it as a team member, it's easy to get your bot into Teams.
- Publish your bot: _Coming soon_
