# Sample applications for the Microsoft Teams Developer Platform (preview)

There are Microsoft Teams samples in our GitHub repositories for you to clone or download:

* ['Maps' tab sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-get-started).  This is the simple example that is used in this documentation.
* ['ToDo list' tab sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-todo).  This is a richer example showing how a real web app can be converted into a Microsoft Teams tab.
