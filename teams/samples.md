# Sample applications for the Microsoft Teams Developer Platform

There are Microsoft Teams samples in our GitHub repositories for you to clone or download:

* ['Maps' tab sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-get-started).  This is the simple example that is used in this documentation.
* [Simple Todo List tab sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-todo).  This Node.js sample shows how easy it is to convert an existing web app into a tab.
