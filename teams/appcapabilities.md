# App Capabilities

Here is a list of some the capabilities your experience can leverage today.

## Tabs

Tabs allow team members to access your service on a dedicated canvas, within a channel or in user's personal app space. You can leverage your existing web app to create a great tab experience within Teams.

Tabs in channels ("configurable tabs") allow teams to work directly with the tools and data you provide, in the channel's context, and to have conversations about them. Examples of tabs include dashboards and data visualization, documents and notes, group task management and shared design canvases.

Personal tabs ("static tabs") provide information for individual users, in your own dedicated app space.  Use these tabs to surface information catering to the individual such as personal task lists or dashboards, or provide help or other product information.

## Bots

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with Microsoft Teams users naturally through chat. Bots can answer natural language questions and perform lightweight tasks such as querying bug information or kicking off a build.â€‹ Any bot you've created using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) can easily be made to work in Microsoft Teams.

While bots can take advantage of the rich natural language processing provided by the Bot Framework, your bot can also serve as the command line interface for your experience.  Or you can choose to make a notification-only bot, serving only to serve up information relevant to your users.
