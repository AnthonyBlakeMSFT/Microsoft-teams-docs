# Side loading your bot or tab in a team (early preview)

With the latest release, you will need to side-load a zip package containing the manifest for your bot or your tab.

1.	To start, navigate to the team, click on the overflow (“…”), and select View team.

   !["View team"](../images/viewteam.jpg)

2.	Click on the Bots tab at the top of the page.  (This is the right place to go even if you're building a tab.)

3.	Click on Sideload a bot or tab on the lower left.

5.	You will see your side loaded bot or tab in the list.

If you're adding a tab, it should now appear in the tab gallery as normal.

If you're adding a bot:
 
1.	You will see a post in the General channel indicating the bot has been added to the team.

2.	You can start by invoking your bot by @mentioning the name of the bot, which should autocomplete.

3.  To test direct chats with your bot, you should first @mention it in a channel.  You can then start a 1:1 chat with it – e.g. via ‘New Chat’ or Search. 

## Troubleshooting

If the manifest doesn't load, please double-check you've followed all the instructions [here](manifest.md).

In particular, for tabs, note the size limitations on icons included in your side-load package.

## Submitting your manifest for consideration

See the [instructions](../submission.md) for submitting your bot or tab for consideration.
