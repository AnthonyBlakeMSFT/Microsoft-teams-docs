## Ways to contribute

You can contribute to [Microsoft Teams developer documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/) in a  few different ways:

* Contribute to articles via the [public Microsoft Teams SDK developer docs repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-docs) 
* Report documentation bugs via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content/issues)

>**Note:** We're only taking documentation contributions from authors within Microsoft presently. We will open the repository for the Microsoft Teams content to non-Microsoft contributors soon.

##Before we can accept your pull request

###Minor corrections

Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repository do not require a Contribution License Agreement (CLA). Submissions are taken in the form of pull requests. We will do our best to review pull requests within ten business days.

###Larger submissions

If you submit new or significant changes to documentation and code examples, you need to send a signed Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your pull request if you are in one of these groups:

* Members of the Microsoft Open Technologies group.
* Contributors who don't work for Microsoft.

As a community member, **you must sign the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before you can contribute large submissions to this project**, but you only need complete and submit the documentation once. Please carefully review the document; you may also need to have your employer sign the document.

Signing the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) does not grant you rights to commit to the main repository, but it does mean that the Office Developer and Content Publishing teams will be able to review and consider your contributions and you will get credit if we do.

You can download the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content/raw/master/Contribution%20License%20Agreement.pdf). Please fill out the form and email it to [officedev@microsoft.com](mailto:officedev@microsoft.com).
